		<h2>Overview</h2>
		Homework 1 is all about rasterizing triangles and applying transformations. We start simple with drawing
		single-color triangles, then move on to antialiasing by supersampling, transforms, barycentric coordinates,
		texture mapping, and level sampling with mipmaps. The goal is ultimately to display images to the screen
		with the ability to utilize multiple different sampling methods, texture application methods, and sample rates.
		This assignment has been very exciting because I now feel I have an in-depth understanding of exactly how
		we visualize images and 3D objects using computer code.

		<h2>Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Rasterizing triangles consists of computing the line equations for each pair of vertices, then checking which pixels on the screenshot
				are inside the triangle (or on the edges) based off those equations. A point is "inside" the triangle if each line equation evalates to
				values of the same sign (or 0). This is because the line equations are defined such that they are positive on one side of the line and
				negative on the other side. If a point is inside the triangle, then the point is colored with the triangle's color.
			</li>
			<li>
				My algorithm is no worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle, because that is exactly what it does. Rather
				than checking each pixel in the framebuffer, my algorithm calculates the bounding box of the triangle based on its vertices, then loops through
				each pixel within the bounding box. This makes the algorithm more efficient because it can drasticly reduce the number of pixels we need to check
				for each triangle.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				My algorithm relies on the specified sample rate to calculate a sample step and sqrt sample rate.
				The sample rate specifies the distance between sample points within a pixel, and taking the sqrt
				of that rate is useful for iterating through each sample point within the pixel. My algorithm also uses
				the sample buffer data structure to store the color values for each sample point, rather than
				immediately drawing to the framebuffer.
			</li>
			<li>
				With these values, my algorithm checks each sample point within the pixel to see if it is inside
				the triangle or on an edge. If it is, the sample point is colored with the triangle's color. 
				After all sample points are checked, the color of the pixel is calculated by averaging the color
				values of all the sample points within it.
			</li>
			<li>
				To implement supersampling, I modified the rasterization pipeline to increase the sampling resolution,
				use a sample buffer to store color values instead of immediately drawing to the frame buffer, calculate
				positions of sample points, and average the color values of all sample points within a pixel.
			</li>
			<li>
				Averaging the color values of multiple sample points within a pixel smoohts out edges and reduces
				jaggies, more accurately representing the coverage of the triangle within each pixel and resulting
				in a higher quality image.
			</li>
			<li>
				We can see that edges become blurred and jaggies are reduced as the sample rate increases. 
				This is because the higher the sample rate, the more sample points are checked within each pixel,
				resulting in better representation of the image at sharp edges and a blurred effect due to the
				averaging of sample point color values within each pixel.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Task 3: Transforms</h2>
		I wanted to make my robot politely curtsy and tip his hat to the viewer. I had to rotate and translate the pieces of his legs and arm, then
		create a new group of objects for his hat which I rotated, transformed, and scaled, then made blue.

		<h2>Task 4: Barycentric coordinates</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Barycentric coordinates are a way to represent a point within a triangle (or any polygon) as a linear combination or weighted average
				of the triangle's vertices. We use a set of numbers that represent the "weights" of each vertex in the linear combination, with the sum
				of the weights equaling 1. Because barycentric coordinates linearly interpolate values at each vertex, we can use them to interpolate
				colors at each vertex to find the color of a point within the triangle.
			</li>
			<li>
				For example below, we have a triangle with vertices colored red, green, and blue. We can use barycentric coordinates to interpolate
				the color of a point within the triangle by calculating the barycentric coordinates of the point, then using those coordinates to
				interpolate the color of the point based on the colors of the vertices. In this case it provides us with a nice gradient between each color.

		<h2>Task 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Texture mapping is a technique used to apply a texture to a 3D model. It involves mapping a 2D image to a 3D model's surface.
				In this task, we implement texture mapping by sampling the texture image at each pixel
				of the model's surface, then applying the color of the texture to the pixel using either nearest neighbor or bilinear interpolation.
			</li>
			<li>
				I implemented pixel sampling to fetch the color from the texture based on the interpolated UV coordinates for
				each sample point within the triangle. I used the texture's width and height to calculate the UV coordinates
				for each sample point, then fetched the color from the texture at those coordinates.
			</li>
			<li>
				Nearest neighbor sampling is a simple method that fetches the color of the nearest texel to the UV coordinates.
				Bilinear interpolation is a more complex method that fetches the colors of the four nearest texels to the UV coordinates,
				then interpolates the colors based on the distance of the sample point from each texel.
			</li>
			<li>
				In the cases of both nearest neighbor and bilinear pixel sampling, sampling at a higher sample rate produces a smoother
				and more clear image. Generally, though, bilinear sampling produces a smoother image than nearest neighbor sampling,
				especially when given a lower-resolution texture,
				when a texture is magnified, when a texture is rotated or skewed, or when the texture involves smooth gradients.
				This is because bilinear sampling interpolates colors, resulting in blending and smoothing, while nearest neighbor
				tends to be more blocky and less smooth.

			</div>
		</ul>

		<h2>Task 6: "Level Sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Level sampling is a way to sample textures at different resolutions based on the distance of the texture from the "camera."
				When a texture is far away, we can sample the texture at a lower resolution to save computation time and memory. When a texture
				is closer, we can sample the texture at a higher resolution to provide more detail.
			</li>
			<li>
				To implement level sampling, I modified the rasterize_textured_triangle function to calculate the UV barycentric coordinates
				for the points (x, y), (x + 1, y), and (x, y + 1), then pass them into the Texture::sample function to get the color for each sample point.
				I also modified the get_level() and sample() helpers to calculate the appropriate mipmap levels based on the distance of the texture
				and to sample the texture based on the specified level and pixel sampling methods.
			</li>
			<li>
				Speed and memory usage tend to have an inverse relationship with antialising power. For pixel sampling, nearest neighbor is faster and more
				memory-efficient than bilinear, but the latter produces smoother images by blending colors of adjacent texels.
				For level sampling, L_Zero < L_Nearest < L_Linear in terms of speed and memory usage, with antialising power increasing at each
				option respectively. This is because each reduces the aliasing artifacts of the one before it and provides more detail
				or smoother transitions between mipmap levels.
				Lastly, an increased sample rate means smoother edges and fewer aliasing artifacts, but with the tradeoff of increased
				memory usage at each increased sample rate.
			</li>
